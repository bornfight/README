description: A simple framework for interrupting people the right way

Operation Fruit Fly

The philosophy behind this is the following:

> “Interruptions are generally bad and an often ignored part of the problem, so lets make everyone's life better by
> structuring them into something readable”
>
> The idea is not to cancel talking to people, it’s to have a mindset that when you need something there are these
> points you could think about, be aware of your problem, and maximise focus by describing it in a better way.

### Some ground rules

- Mentorship and support are not the same thing as an interruption.

- It’s one thing if we have made an arrangement to talk to each other or I am dedicated to you, it’s quite another
  if you just appear behind me.

- This is not a definition or procedure on how to ping someone, it is more of a bullet point list of what to have
  in mind when you need assistance.

### When is it not ok to interrupt someone?

- When they’re putting a spoon or a fork into their mouth, in other words, it’s not ok to interrupt someone during
  lunch. Consider it their private time and everyone should respect that.

- If they’re on a break. On the terrace, having coffee, lying down and you see they’re trying to relax a bit. We
  all need some alone time, you can always ask “can you ping me when you have a minute”
- If you see someone is in the zone, focused and glued to something. You can again send a little chat message “let
  me know when you have 5 minutes”. It much better then poking him physically. Don’t break the zone :)

### When is it perfectly ok to interrupt a colleague?

- When you know you are both on the same project/feature and you have both established the “just let me know if you
  need anything” policy
- If you’ve tried at least 2 things to fix your problem. Take 10 minutes and try and solve it yourself. If you are
  not sure how, that’s ok too, write down 2 ideas what the problem could be and how to solve it. Send it to the
  person you wanted to check with. Bare in mind, it is totally ok to be wrong here, the important part is to try
  first so you get the hang of the thinking process, and not just expect someone else to fix your problem.
- If it is a complete emergency, put it in a few sentences why this is so urgent and let the person know everything
  you tried so far.

### Things to keep in mind:

- “I don’t want to ask him/her, they seem so busy, I have a feeling im disturbing him/her” - This is ok, but you
  can also send a chat message “I have a question that will last cca 10 minutes, it’s not urgent now, can you ping
  me when you have some time”
- Don’t always necessarily ping the same person - go around, meet new people :)
- If it’s something potentially simple, try to find assistance in someone new

### What the general flow should look like:

- I’m working, typing about, everything is fine!

- I’m stuck at something!

- Is it one of the following:

  - It’s a bug and I have no clue what it is
  - I have an error that I don’t recognize
  - Something is behaving in a way that’s not normal
  - Something that is not code related is wrong (CICD/git/server/database/etc)
  - There’s no documentation for something
  - I have no clue where to start
  - I need someone to discuss an idea or feature

- Write it down! Use words and letters on “paper” to express your problem. You get a different idea by thinking
  about it and be able to send it in a message.

- If it’s an error, or a literal string that shows up, google it first.

- Take 10-15 minutes of your time to try and figure out the problem yourself

- It still isn’t working! Put 2 things into actual words and sentences about what you think the problem is, and
  what would fix it - it’s totally ok to be wrong. There will be no judging you!

- Think about who would be the best person to ask:

  - He or she was on a similar project
  - I overheard a similar issue
  - He or she was on this project so he could have deeper insight
  - I have a mentor, so I go to my mentor because that’s our arrangement
  - This is a generic non project related problem, can I ask anyone?
  - Can I simply send it to a message channel instead of going to one person?

- Send a message “Do you have a minute, i have this xy issue, I’ve tried this and this”

- You get together, you sort it out

- Everyone is completely happy
