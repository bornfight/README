title: Naming new stuff
description: Give everything a fancy name, it really helps
---
It is my ([Tony](https://github.com/tonymrakovcic))  strong opinion that every new project, idea, process or something that needs to be a team wide effort, needs to have an identity.

For something to have an identity, it needs a good name.

I always use [Military name generator](http://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/military-operation-names.php).

Get a feeling of what your idea symbolizes, and click on "Get operation names" a few dozen times until something sticks out.

This brought about the lovely project names as:

- "Cobalt Friday" - 4 hours every Friday of "whatever time", dedicated to whatever you want to do
- "Operation Fruit Fly" - An idea/methodology for better handling interruptions 
- "Dust rabbit" - A composer based WP dev environment procedure
- "Operation Cavalry" - A new definition of workflow with the senior team 
- "Operation Time Predator" - An attempt to improve the agendas of meetings
- "Operation Full Moon" - A day off after the christmas party :D
- "Operation Blind Cactus" - A suggestion for the company wide restructuring project, didn't stick :D


This does not involve naming code, please name your variables and classes and methods as to what they do :)
