title: Who we are
description: Insight into the team and what we deem important
---

We are software development and design company from Zagreb, Croatia.

We build high quality custom software, mobile apps and websites. You can browse
[our website](https://www.bornfight.com/) for more detailed information

To see some of our values and the way we think, we have made this short [video](https://vimeo.com/290462853)

We've come close to the philosophy from the video because we aren't growing the team with 'lone wolves', but
developers who want to learn something new, who want to share that knowledge with others and who are ready to jump
into that problem-solving mode whenever they encounter any kind of challenge. And, of course, have fun while
they're doing it!

One of our company goals has always been to create a workplace where developers can quickly grow their professional
careers and use all of their skills to create the most useful projects for our clients.

We basically have three types of projects we do, we fit them into one of the following categories

- Product - projects that transform or define a clients business
- Creative - Award winning advanced websites that stand out
- Mobile - Mobile apps that revolve around the clients needs

We are divided into units, that focus on these specific types of projects.

Right now, we have about 25 people in our Software Development department (backend, mobile and QA). (this post will
not be updated every time this changes :), it will be from time to time)

That's a lot of amazing minds who can look at a project from countless sides to find the right way to deliver the
best result.
