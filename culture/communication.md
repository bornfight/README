description: What we use for what to talk to others
---
We have a few channels of internal communication.

[Slack](https://bornfight.slack.com) for internal communication and chat

[GSuite](https://mail.google.com/) for email, calendars, documents and slides

Sometimes hangouts for chat, this is not ideal to have 2 chat programs, we are aware of this, but for now you can expect to sometimes get messages from people on either slack or hangouts.

[Teamwork](https://degordian.teamwork.com) for project based task management

Facebook groups that every new member is invited to, Bornfight, Service information for communication regarding everything in the building (since we share offices with our sister companies [Degordian](https://www.degordian.com) and [Mediatoolkit](https://www.mediatolkit.com)
