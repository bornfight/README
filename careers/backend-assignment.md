# Welcome to the Bornfight "Army assignment" instructions!

You may have gotten this link during our selection process for becoming a part of our team. If so, read on, this is
what you need to do!

The assignment is as follows:

- Create a mini battle program consisting of two armies.

- Your solution should basically be a text-based war between these two armies.

- Each army should consist of a number of soldiers that are passed as parameters.

- The army sizes should be passed through a GET parameter, for example`?army1=50&army2=48`

You are required to implement at least one idea of your own, that introduces an element of randomness (it could be
generals, earthquakes, soldiers poisoning each other, priests, dragons... we'll leave that up to you).

### <u>The solution must, in some way, return which army has won the battle.</u>

Battle logic, army structure, data types, class structure, file structure, outputs (if there are any), the choice
of framework or no framework at all, any new idea or feature - is completely up to you.

Basically, we are trying to figure out how youâ€™ll implement these features, since you are not tied to anything and
can do your very best.

### The solution you provide should reflect this specification and, although you may introduce your own new features and ideas, it is important that the initial brief is met.

---

## What will be evaluated in the solution:

- Object-oriented design and architecture
- Correct usage and implementation of design patterns
- Structure and placement of files and classes
- Code cleanliness
- Code consistency
- General elements of well written code

#### If you choose to use a framework to solve this task, we will expect you to use the framework as it was designed, keeping in mind its rules, structure, best practices and standards.

## What will NOT be evaluated:

- Visual design of the solution
- Visual layout of the solution
- Frontend of the solution
- Graphical interface of the solution (if you choose to make one)

## How to submit your solution:

You can submit your result in a zip file and send it through an email or use a GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket repo.

## Extra points:

- Write tests you deem important
- Use types
- A linter passing codebase
- Implement error handling and/or logging
- Provide simple documentation

#### In case of using a framework, use an existing open source module and integrate it into the solution

## The amount of time needed to solve this is about 5-10 hours. <br> You will receive a deadline via email - it will be more than enough to complete the task.
