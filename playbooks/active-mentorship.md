description: Guide for practicing active mentorship between a mentor and mentee
---

Every junior team member has a dedicated mentor assigned to them for guidance, questions and general technical
mentorship.

To provide structure into the mentorship, we follow a daily routine sessions in which the mentee can ask their
mentor questions and discuss given topics.

The routine can be practiced as follows:

-   keep the mentoring session short and focused
-   maximum time is 30 minutes
-   no minimum time is specified, meaning the session does not have to happen if there are no topics to discuss
-   the mentee should prepare specific questions
-   the mentee can track discussed topics, conclusions and ideas inside a dedicated mentor-mentee doc, visible to both parties
