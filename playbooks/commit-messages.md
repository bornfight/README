In order to help yourself and your fellow coworkers, follow these 7 simple rules for writing quality and useful
commit messages:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line - this just means “spoken or written as if giving a command or
  instruction”. A few examples are "Clean your room", "Close the door", "Take out the trash"
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

If you're in a Jetbrains IDE, we recommend using their interface cause it really helps and speeds things up, the
shortcut is "CMD + k" on mac

When it comes to writing the commit subject line, just follow this simple rule:

> If applied, this commit will \<insert your subject\>.
