**NoticeÔ∏è**: These are not "set in stone" rules, but should be followed as much as possible.

GitHub is the git client used in JavaScript repositories.

Each singular project should have a
[Pull Request Template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)
which is helpful for consistency in PRs amongst different developers. This is a
[recommended/default Pull Request Template](https://github.com/bornfight/README/blob/master/playbooks/pull-request-templates/pull-request-frontend-react.md#readme)
we have created, it can be customized for further use on a project or used as is.

**Code review on GitHub** Code review is also included in our processes. Its most common followed rule is that each
PR should pass atleast 1 reviewer. After it has been reviewed, a PR's creator should solve all the
comments/suggestions/issues that the reviewer has left. Only after all has been completed, it is eligible for
merging to master. Recommended PR size is approximately 250 lines of code. Everything largely above such a mark
should be separated into 2 or more PRs depending on the size of the code lines changed.
