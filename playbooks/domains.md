We use 4 different services for buying and setting up our domains.

[Name.com](https://www.name.com) as a registrar for TLDs <br>
[Regica](https://www.regica.net) for all our .hr domains <br>
[EuropeRegistry](https://www.europeregistry.com/) for all country based domains that are not .hr (for example .at, .si, .hu, etc) <br>
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a nameserver for setting up DNS records

If you are requested to buy a domain, feel free to log in into any of these systems and purchase one.
Some of the services have 2fa set up. If you do not have 2fa for the account set up, it will clearly say who  you need to contact.

The default nameservers are set up on regica and name.com and will be automatically added to the domain when it is purchased. 
name.com and europeregistry have our corporate credit card connected so you can just use them.
