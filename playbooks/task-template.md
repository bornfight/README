title: Task template
description: When you create a new task, what should it contain?
---

### Title / what to do (mandatory):
- Explain the core of the feature in just a few words
- e.g. *Integrating app with external service*

### Description in detail (mandatory):
- Explain in detail what needs to be implemented
- e.g. "JWT auth needs to be implemented for communication with external service. Models from our app need to be mapped to XML (a parser could be useful or it can be done manually)"

### Things to keep in mind (optional):
- Validation
- Relationship with other parts of the app
- Optimizations
- Other potential issues

### Resources (optional):
- Zeplin
- An example of implementation (e.g. some other project or Stackoverflow)
- An article related to the topic
- API tokens/keys which are necessary for implementation
- Content docs (e.g. text within email)

### Estimation (mandatory/optional):
- Research needs to be done about this
- We have input field for storypoints in Jira, but we don't use that measure all the time (maybe we need standardization?)

### Final output? (optional)
- This category might seem like it could be useful or needed, but everything should be clear from previous paragraphs. If it's not clear, it means that task creator/delegator needs to improve/modify existing text
