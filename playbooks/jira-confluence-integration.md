title: Jira and Confluence integration
description: Deep integration between the documentation and tasks
---

We use JIRA + Confluence as a project management suite for a lot of product apps. These tools are very powerful on
their own, but they are the best when used as a whole. Confluence supports deep linking to JIRA issues and
therefore a Confluence page can be used a _source of truth_ for a status of a larger product requirement, an epic
or sprint.

Accessing the JIRA integration is done with a slash command in Confluence. From there, new tasks can be created or
existing issues can be listed in a Confluence page.
