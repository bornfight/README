description:  Everything you need to know as a new team member in Bornfight development
---
Every new team member, no matter what team they are in, are included in a company wide onboarding program.

The program consists of 40ish hours of educations, presentations and "shadowing" that happen in the first 2 months you are here.

This is the same for all new members, it doesn't matter if your a student, a junior developer, a team leader or the new COO.

A little script is in place, for adding all new hires to all the events in the calendar. On your first day, you will get  all the relevant invites.

Every team has two events for presenting themselves and introducing new people on what they do day to day:
 
 - Team introduction presentation
 - "Wednesday at 2 o'clock" - a session with the team where they try do show you what they do hands on, you see how and what they are currently working on, can ask questions and even be involved sometimes

  
With your team lead, you will have 2 scheduled meetings

- QT - "Quality time" which happens every month, approx. 30 minute informal chat about what you whats working and whats not. 
- Biannual structured meeting that involves feedback from both sides, a channel to express what motivates and demotivates you, what directino you want to go in in your career and your satisfaction with equipment, pay, vacation days, the environment you work in, and the organization of work and people. These meetings happen in April and October.
