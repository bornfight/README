description: Hello and welcome!

You will receive a Github invite shortly, if you haven't already.

Every new developer gets added to the "Team developers" Github team which has access to almost all repositories. There are a few repos that are not added but mostly because they are external and not needed, mostly hosted by us.

Also, when there is a need, a separate team will be created for a specific project.  
You are responsible for setting up notifications for what you want to be notified about.

**Please set up 2FA.**

For some repos, and projects, our dear colleagues from Mediatoolkit and Degordian are collaborating within Bornfight Github organization, so they are also added.
Feel free to look around, poke through a project, if you feel like it make a PR.
Your first task will probably be a simple issue from one of those repos.

Look through the [playbook](../playbooks) section to see how we do things.

Look through [education](../education) to see how we try to stay smart.

Look through [our tools](../tools) to what we use to get things done.

If you see anything that should be changed, don't hesitate to make an issue!
