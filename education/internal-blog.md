description: How to use "DevEdu"
---
Our [internal DevEdu blog](https://deghq.com/wordpress/devedu/) ðŸ”’ is used only internally.

The idea is anything goes

- you have 3 commands on how to install something specific, ok!
- You made an error and want to document it so it doesn't happen again, cool!
- You managed to hack something into working and want to share it - nice!
- You made a tool to automate something and want to let others know, thanks!
- You do something 5 times, and just want to remember the steps - good for you!
- You found a cool new way of doing something  - write about it!
- There's something everyone stumbles on and want them to read a doc beforehand - do it!
- Want to share a neat url, do it, or use our slack "shareurl" command which puts it into a blog post
- Do's and Don't of a tool, let us now!


Sometimes, internal blog posts evolve into a big public facing post, but don't worry yourself with that.

These posts can be micro, small, medium or big, the idea is sharing. Try to do some code highlighting, and spellchecking, but don't overthink it, it's a safe and simple place :)

Don't be surprised if you use your own blog post every now and then, when you want to remind yourself how to do something.

And when someone asks a question you know is on the blog, you can just send them the link!

You can find the [hall of fame here ](https://deghq.com/wordpress/devedu/all-time-bloggers/)ðŸ”’.

There are also some [topic up for grabs](https://deghq.com/wordpress/devedu/topics-up-for-grabs/)ðŸ”’  that team mates want to read about, but don't exist yet.

The rule is, when you take a topic from "up for grabs" and write about it, just put 2 new ones into the list, something YOU would want to read about. That way, we always have a place with ideas on topics.
