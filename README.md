# Bornfight Development ![Travis](https://api.travis-ci.org/bornfight/README.svg?branch=master)

Welcome to Bornfight!

This repo is a living source of internal documentation.

Our team vision is

> Always create significance

so we we feel that this type of repo is definitely a step in the right direction in terms of documentation,
processes, ideas and of course sharing all of that with the world.

Feel free to reach out to your mentor or anyone else on the team with questions, or try the
[#dev Slack channel](https://bornfight.slack.com/messages/general-development) ðŸ”’.

> This is currently a heavy work in progress, so feel free to add a PR for whatever you think is needed. There is
> an [Up for grabs](topics-up-for-grabs.md) file you can check to get some ideas

The repo is split out into different sections, each one has a summary of what's inside to make it easy to browse.

If you are here because you are a new member of the team, we highly encourage you to look around and find ONE thing
to add, edit or point out. It can be fixing a typo, adding an issue like "explain this in more detail please", or
make a PR adding some relevant content where you see you could contribute. Small collaborations, distributed on a
large number of people, can make this repo better for all of us! Have a look at
[getting started](getting-started/first-notes.md)

This repo is heavily inspired by the [README repo of Artsy](https://github.com/artsy/README).

We believe the ideas, philosophy, culture, implementation and content expressed there is something that is both
brilliant and inspiring. The repo is not forked, it is just a copy built on similar scripts and ideas, with their
approval of course.
