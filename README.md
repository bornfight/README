# Bornfight Developers [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/README.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/README)

Welcome to Bornfight!

This repo is a living source of internal documentation. 
Reach out to your mentor or anyone else on the team with questions, or try the [#dev Slack channel](https://bornfight.slack.com/messages/general-development) ðŸ”’.

This repo is heavily inspired by the [README repo of Artsy](https://github.com/artsy/README).
 
We believe the ideas, philosophy, culture, implementation and content expressed there is something that is both brilliant and inspiring.
The repo is not forked, it is just a copy built on similar scripts and ideas.


The repo is split out into different sections, each one has a summary of what's inside to make it easy to browse.
